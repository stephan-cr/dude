# options and constraints
# =======================
#
# the program to be used is bin/example.py
# it takes 3 parameters: operation operand operand

optspace = {
    'operation' : ['times', 'div', 'plus', 'minus'],
    'left'      : range(0, 2),
    'right'     : range(0, 1),
    'runs'      : range(3)
}

# order experiments according to the following comparison function (optional)

def optpt_cmp(optpt1, optpt2):
    return cmp(optpt1, optpt2)

# the experiments are the cartesian product of the options.
# we can define constraints to remove undesired experiments from the set,
# for example, we don't want to divide by zero.

def non_zero_div(optpt):
    operation = optpt['operation']
    right = optpt['right']
    return not (operation == 'div' and right == 0)

# all constraints should be put in the following list

constraints = [ non_zero_div ]

# but the variable can also be set to [] if there are no constraints.


# executing the experiments
# =========================

# the results of the executions will be placed in the following directory

raw_output_dir = "raw"

# if nothing should be done, only define the function as above.
# note that the current working directory when prepare exp is called is not the
# directory where dude is called. if you want to access that directory use the
# predefined variable root (see the following example)

# cmdl_exp returns a string that is the command to be executed. It can contain
# environment variables and parameters as any command line.
# note that the working directory is some subdirectory of "raw_output_dir".
# to access the example.py I use the root variable here, which points to the
# directory where the script was called.

def cmdl_exp(optpt):
    program = root + "/bin/example.py"

        ' ' + str(optpt['left']) + \
        ' ' + str(optpt['right'])
    return cmd

# additional methods
# ------------------
#

# before starting each experiment, we have the opportunity to add files or run
# other commands by defining the following function.

def prepare_exp(optpt):
    pass

# before any experiment

def prepare_global():
    pass

# after executing the command

def finish_exp(optpt, status):
    pass


# summaries
# =========
#
# the above configuration is enough to run all the experiments. now we have
# additional configurations to summarize the raw data.

# "output" is the directory where the summarized/parsed/etc data will be saved

sum_output_dir = "output"

# we can create any number of summaries.

    )

# dimensions are referent to options.
# groupby will split the data in groups using the keys given in the list.
# in this example we split the data by operations (minus, plus, etc)
# setting headers
# we must define a process function, which takes the "point" in the dimensions,
# the output (stdout) file stream of the experiment, and a summary writable file
# stream where the summary data should be written. In this example I print
# multiple lines with columns being: left right result
# summaries should be a list. can be empty
